# Here's some new strange stuff, remeber type it exactly.
# assign a string to days
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
# assign a stirng to months 
# btw '\n' 应该也是print 的关键词 效果是后面的东西打印在下一行，如果后面没东西应该是光标在下一行。
months = "\nJan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"
# print a string first, then print the variable days
print("Here are the days: ",days)
# print a string first, then print the variable months
print("Here are the months: ", months)
# I don't understand and I was shocked.
# Why there are three double-quotes then we can print as much lines as we want?
# print four lines of string in three double-quotes 
print("""
There's something going on here.
With the three double-quotes.
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
